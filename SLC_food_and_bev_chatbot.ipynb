    "A: 1. Chautaqua Dining Hall - Boulder was the birthplace of the Chautauqua social and educational movement, centered on a former Methodist camp meeting site. Today the site is a sprawling park with a collection of historic bungalows that back up to the Flatirons, including the original dining hall, which now offers a modern menu of Colorado cuisine. Across breakfast, lunch, and dinner, uniquely Colorado accents like elk sausage, bison burgers, and green chile grace the menu, alongside American classics like eggs Benedict, fried chicken sandwiches, and roasted chicken.\n",

    "2. Pearl Street Pub & Cellar - On the tony Pearl Street thoroughfare, Pearl Street Pub & Cellar is a popular game-day destination with a treasure trove of Denver Broncos paraphernalia. The bar is known for its fried mac and cheese bites and some of the best burgers and wings in town, served into the wee hours. Happy hour runs late and the bar offers great drink specials, plus pool tables, foosball, darts, and occasional live music. Celebrating a birthday? Itâ€™s a Boulder tradition to kiss the taxidermied buffalo head.\n",
